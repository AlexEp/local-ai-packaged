# Hardware Recommendation for Self-Hosted AI Package

Based on a thorough review of the repository, here is a complete guide to selecting a PC that can effectively run this entire Docker-based AI stack.

### **Hardware Recommendation Summary**

This project is a comprehensive, self-hosted AI platform composed of **over 20 interconnected microservices** running in Docker. The hardware requirements are significant due to the sheer number of concurrent processes and the demanding nature of the key components.

The most resource-intensive parts of this stack are:

*   **Ollama:** The service for running local Large Language Models (LLMs). This is the primary driver for needing a powerful GPU with substantial VRAM, and it also consumes significant RAM.
*   **Multiple, Concurrent Databases:** The system runs at least five different database systems simultaneously, each with its own memory and CPU footprint:
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Used by both Supabase and Langfuse.
    *   **Qdrant:** A vector database for AI-powered search (RAG).
    *   **Neo4j:** A memory-intensive graph database.
    *   **Clickhouse:** A columnar database for analytics.
    *   **Redis/Valkey:** An in-memory cache.
*   **Supabase:** This is not a single application but a full backend-as-a-service suite, including a dozen services for authentication, file storage, an API gateway, and more.
*   **Application Services:** Other applications like `n8n`, `flowise`, and `open-webui` all add to the baseline CPU and RAM usage.

Given this complexity, a standard consumer laptop or a low-end desktop would struggle. The following recommendations are designed to comfortably run all these services at once.

### **Detailed Component Breakdown**

*   **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** A modern processor with at least **6 cores and 12 threads** is necessary to manage all the parallel services.
    *   *Examples:* AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or newer; Intel Core i5-12600K or newer.

*   **RAM (Random Access Memory):** This is critical for stability. I **strongly recommend 64 GB** for a smooth experience. 32 GB should be considered the absolute minimum.

*   **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** The GPU is the heart of the AI capabilities. The most important metric is VRAM. An **NVIDIA GPU with at least 8 GB of VRAM** is required, but **12 GB or more is highly recommended** for flexibility with larger AI models.
    *   *Examples:* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12GB), RTX 4060 Ti (8GB/16GB), RTX 4070 Super (12GB), or better.

*   **Storage:** A fast **NVMe SSD with at least 1 TB of capacity** is essential for database performance and for quickly loading AI models. 2 TB is recommended for long-term use.

### **PC Configuration Tiers**

Here are three sample builds to match different budgets and performance goals.

#### **Tier 1: Minimum Viable Configuration**
*This build is the baseline required to run the stack. Expect limitations on AI model size and potential slowdowns under heavy load.*

*   **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i5-12400
*   **RAM:** 32 GB DDR4
*   **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (12 GB)
*   **Storage:** 1 TB NVMe SSD

#### **Tier 2: Recommended Configuration (Best Value)**
*This is the sweet spot. It will provide a smooth, responsive experience and allows for experimentation with larger, more capable AI models.*

*   **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 7700X or Intel Core i5-13600K
*   **RAM:** 64 GB DDR5
*   **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Super (12 GB)
*   **Storage:** 2 TB NVMe SSD

#### **Tier 3: Enthusiast / Future-Proof Configuration**
*This build is for users who want to eliminate performance bottlenecks and run very large AI models.*

*   **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 7950X or Intel Core i9-13900K
*   **RAM:** 64 GB or 128 GB DDR5
*   **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super (16 GB) or RTX 4090 (24 GB)
*   **Storage:** 2 TB or 4 TB NVMe SSD

### **Important Additional Considerations**

*   **Operating System:** **Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)** is the ideal choice for performance and stability with Docker. Windows 11 with WSL 2 is a fully supported alternative.
*   **Networking:** A **wired Ethernet connection** is strongly recommended for stability and speed when downloading multi-gigabyte Docker images and AI models.
*   **Power Supply (PSU):** Choose a high-quality, Gold-rated PSU from a reputable brand (e.g., SeaSonic, Corsair). A **750W-850W** unit is a safe choice for the recommended tier.
*   **Cooling:** Ensure your PC has good case airflow and a quality CPU cooler to prevent performance loss from overheating.
